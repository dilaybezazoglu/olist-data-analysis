# 📊 Olist E-Commerce Data Analysis Project

This project is an end-to-end exploratory data analysis and statistical analysis project based on the **Olist Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset**.  
The goal is to transform raw transactional data into meaningful business insights using Python-based data analysis and visualization techniques.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

- Explore customer behavior, order patterns, delivery performance, and satisfaction metrics  
- Identify relationships between spending, delivery time, and customer satisfaction  
- Apply statistical tests to validate business hypotheses  
- Build a clear analytical storyline from raw data to insights

## 📌 Project Structure & Analysis Flow

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning, Transformation & Merge Operations
- Handling missing values and data type conversions  
- Merging multiple relational tables into analysis-ready datasets  
- Feature engineering for delivery time, spending, and satisfaction metrics  

---

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualizations
High-level exploration of the dataset to understand distributions, trends, and anomalies.

---

### 3️⃣ Order Analysis
- Order price statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)  
- Distribution of order prices  
- Order volume patterns  

---

### 4️⃣ Product Category Analysis
- Order count by product category  
- Average satisfaction scores across categories  
- Category-based performance comparisons  

---

### 5️⃣ Delivery Time Analysis
- Average and median delivery times  
- Delivery time variability  
- Boxplots and distribution analysis  

---

### 6️⃣ Customer Satisfaction Analysis
- Average and median review scores  
- Satisfaction rate analysis  
- Distribution of customer ratings  

---

### 7️⃣ Business Question Analyses

#### 🔹 Do customers who spend more tolerate longer delivery times?
- Spending vs. delivery time comparison  
- Behavioral tolerance analysis  

#### 🔹 Does spending amount affect customer satisfaction?
- Correlation analysis between order value and review score  

#### 🔹 Do satisfaction levels vary across product categories?
- Category-based satisfaction comparison  

#### 🔹 Does faster delivery lead to higher satisfaction?
- Delivery time vs. review score analysis  

---

### 8️⃣ Statistical Testing
- Hypothesis definition (null & alternative hypotheses)  
- Group comparisons  
- Appropriate statistical tests (t-test, chi-square where applicable)  
- Interpretation of statistical results in business context  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Delivery speed has a stronger impact on customer satisfaction than spending amount  
- Certain product categories consistently receive higher satisfaction scores  
- Higher spending does not always guarantee higher customer satisfaction  
- Delays beyond a threshold significantly reduce customer ratings  

---

## 📈 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how structured exploratory analysis combined with statistical testing can uncover actionable insights from e-commerce data.  
The findings can support decision-making in logistics optimization, customer experience improvement, and category-level strategy planning.
