- Analyze **order pricing behavior** and spending patterns  
- Evaluate **delivery time performance** and its impact on customer satisfaction  
- Understand **customer satisfaction drivers** using review scores  
- Test business hypotheses using **statistical methods**

---

## 🔍 Analysis Structure

### 1. Order Price Statistics
- Average order price  
- Median order price  
- Price standard deviation  
- Order price distribution (histogram)

---

### 2. Product Category Distribution
- Number of orders per product category (bar chart)  
- Distribution of payment methods (credit card, debit card, boleto)

---

### 3. Delivery Time Statistics
- Average delivery time  
- Median delivery time  
- Delivery time variability  
- Boxplot analysis for delivery duration

---

### 4. Customer Satisfaction Analysis
- Average customer review score  
- Median review score  
- Overall satisfaction rate  
- Comparison of satisfied vs. unsatisfied customers

---

### 5. Business Questions Explored
- Do customers who spend more tolerate longer delivery times?
- Does spending amount affect customer satisfaction?
- Do satisfaction levels differ across product categories?
- Does faster delivery lead to higher customer satisfaction?

---

### 6. Statistical Tests
- Hypothesis definition (null & alternative)
- Group-based comparisons
- Appropriate statistical test selection
- Interpretation of results

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Delivery time is a **strong driver** of customer satisfaction  
- Higher spending does **not necessarily** increase tolerance for delays  
- Customer satisfaction varies significantly across product categories  
- Faster delivery generally correlates with higher review scores
